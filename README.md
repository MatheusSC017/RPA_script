# Voting system automation

This project aims to practice using the Selenium library to create an RPA system, where an .xlsx file will be read that will contain the necessary data to fill in a form, where each line corresponds to a completed form. The data will be used together with the selenium library to fill out a form on the [Feredum](https://ferendum.com/pt/) website, after completing it, the submit will be done and the research links must be extracted and saved in a file.
